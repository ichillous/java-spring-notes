# üóÑÔ∏è MySQL Basics

MySQL is a widely-used open-source relational database management system (RDBMS) that is particularly well-suited for managing large-scale data in web applications. Understanding the basics of MySQL is crucial for effectively storing, querying, and managing data in your Java Spring Boot applications.

## üõ†Ô∏è What is MySQL?

MySQL is a database system that allows you to store, retrieve, and manage data using SQL (Structured Query Language). It is highly scalable, reliable, and widely supported across various platforms.

### üìò Key Concepts in MySQL

1. **Database:**
   - A database is a collection of tables that store related data.
   - Each database in MySQL is identified by a unique name.

   **Example of creating a database:**
   ```sql
   CREATE DATABASE my_database;
   ```

2. **Table:**
   - A table is a structured format to store data, consisting of rows and columns.
   - Each column represents a field (attribute), and each row represents a record.

   **Example of creating a table:**
   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE users (
       id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
       username VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
       email VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
       created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
   );
   ```

3. **Column:**
   - A column defines a specific piece of data within a table, such as `username` or `email`.
   - Each column has a data type, such as `INT`, `VARCHAR`, or `DATE`.

4. **Row:**
   - A row, also known as a record, is a single entry in a table, containing data for each column in that row.

   **Example of inserting a row:**
   ```sql
   INSERT INTO users (username, email) VALUES ('john_doe', 'john@example.com');
   ```

5. **Primary Key:**
   - A primary key is a unique identifier for each row in a table.
   - It ensures that no two rows have the same primary key value.

   **Example:**
   The `id` column in the `users` table is a primary key.

6. **Foreign Key:**
   - A foreign key is a field in one table that uniquely identifies a row in another table.
   - It is used to establish a relationship between the two tables.

   **Example of a foreign key:**
   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE orders (
       order_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
       user_id INT,
       order_date DATE,
       FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(id)
   );
   ```

7. **Index:**
   - An index is a database object that improves the speed of data retrieval.
   - Indexes are created on columns that are frequently used in queries.

   **Example of creating an index:**
   ```sql
   CREATE INDEX idx_username ON users(username);
   ```

### üîÑ Common MySQL Operations

1. **Connecting to MySQL:**
   - You can connect to a MySQL database using the `mysql` command-line client:
     ```bash
     mysql -u root -p
     ```
   - Or, use JDBC in Java to connect:
     ```java
     Connection connection = DriverManager.getConnection(
         "jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/my_database", "root", "password");
     ```

2. **CRUD Operations:**
   - **Create:** Add new records to a table.
     ```sql
     INSERT INTO users (username, email) VALUES ('john_doe', 'john@example.com');
     ```
   - **Read:** Retrieve records from a table.
     ```sql
     SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'john_doe';
     ```
   - **Update:** Modify existing records in a table.
     ```sql
     UPDATE users SET email = 'john_new@example.com' WHERE username = 'john_doe';
     ```
   - **Delete:** Remove records from a table.
     ```sql
     DELETE FROM users WHERE username = 'john_doe';
     ```

3. **Joins:**
   - Joins are used to combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column.

   **Example of an INNER JOIN:**
   ```sql
   SELECT users.username, orders.order_date
   FROM users
   INNER JOIN orders ON users.id = orders.user_id;
   ```

4. **Aggregate Functions:**
   - Aggregate functions perform calculations on multiple rows and return a single result, such as `COUNT`, `SUM`, `AVG`, `MIN`, and `MAX`.

   **Example of using an aggregate function:**
   ```sql
   SELECT COUNT(*) FROM users;
   ```

### üîß Best Practices for MySQL

- **Normalization:**
   - Normalize your database schema to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity.
- **Indexing:**
   - Index frequently queried columns to improve performance.
- **Backup and Recovery:**
   - Regularly back up your database to prevent data loss.
- **Security:**
   - Use strong passwords, and limit database access to authorized users only.
- **Query Optimization:**
   - Optimize your SQL queries for better performance by avoiding unnecessary columns in SELECT statements and using joins efficiently.

## üìú Summary

MySQL is a fundamental technology for managing relational data in modern web applications. Understanding its core concepts, common operations, and best practices will enable you to effectively store and retrieve data in your Java Spring Boot applications.
